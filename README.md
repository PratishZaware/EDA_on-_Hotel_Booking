# EDA_on-_Hotel_Booking

In this EDA project I used hotel booking dataset. This dataset contains booking information for a City hotel and Resort hotel.
As first step, perform data cleaning by removing duplicate rows, handling null values, removing outliers, converting column to
appropriate datatypes.


Then we performed Univariate analysis and Bivariateanalysis.
In Univariate analysis we analyze data as per single feature. from this we found most demanded room type, most popular meal type, most preferred way of booking, which agent has made the most number of bookings, most busier months, from where most number of guests came, most common staylength.

In Bivariate analysis we found that which hotel generates more revenue with the help of adr, percentage of customers that will return, which hotel has higher booking cancellation rate, which channel brings better revenue generatingdeals.
From EDA we got the idea about trends and pattern about customers, Hotel revenues. Customers are coming mostly from European countries, their stay length is mostly less than 5 days. Around 60% bookings are for city hotel and 40% bookings are for Resort hotel, hence city hotel is busier than Resort hotel.
